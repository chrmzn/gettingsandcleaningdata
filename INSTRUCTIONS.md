# Getting and Cleaning Data (Programming Assignment)

## Instructions

To create the tidy dataset follow the instructions below...

1. Clone the repository locally
2. Execute the run_analysis.R
  * The best way to do this is to simply source() the file from the console which will create the tidy data set and write it as tidyData.txt into your working directory
`source('gettingsandcleaningdata/run_analysis.R')`
  * It requires that the Samsung data is in the same location as the run_analysis.R not your working directory. So just source the file and the dont modify the repository
3. Tidy data will be made available in your current working directory for R
